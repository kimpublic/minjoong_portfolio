Hello! I’m **Minjoong Kim**, currently studying **Computer Science (Games & Animation Emphasis)** at **Brigham Young University (BYU)**.  

Growing up, I always loved art. After winning a small award in an elementary school art contest, I began to value things that look and sound beautiful.  
That love for aesthetics naturally led me to fall in love not only with playing games but also with everything that makes them immersive—**visual design, background music, and storytelling**.  
I also adore **musicals** and **animation**, especially **musical animation**.

That’s why I chose to major in **CS Animation at BYU**.  
This page is a collection of my personal works and creative projects. I hope you enjoy browsing!

> **Tools:** Autodesk Maya | Substance Painter

## Works


### 🎬 Project 1 — *Where the Gaze Lands*

![Where the Gaze Lands](assets/works/where_the_gaze_lands_main.jpg)

> *“Our eyes follow our hearts.”*

This was my very first modeling project created in Maya — my first encounter with 3D art.  
At that time, my third sister got married, and I wanted to make something to celebrate her wedding.

When a father walks his daughter down the aisle, countless emotions must cross his mind.  
He blesses her happiness while realizing that he is no longer her strongest protector.  
In that moment, he might feel a quiet sense of loss or emotions too deep to describe.  
I wanted to capture that fragile yet profound moment.

This piece depicts **three figures** — the bride, the groom, and the bride’s father.  
While the father’s and groom’s gazes are clearly directed, **the bride’s gaze is intentionally left unseen**.  
Because where we look often reveals where our heart truly belongs.  

So, **whom is the bride looking at?**


### 🏠 Project 2 — *Untitled (Red Brick House)*

![Untitled (Red Brick House)](assets/works/red_brick_house_main.jpg)

> *“Every home holds a story — even the ones we only dream about.”*

When I was a child, the neighborhood I grew up in was filled with **red brick houses**.  
They stood along narrow alleyways — unorganized, yet full of warmth and familiarity.  
My family moved frequently when I was young. We never owned a house.  
(Thankfully, we’ve now settled down in one place.)  

As a child, I didn’t like moving all the time.  
I often wished that one of those red brick houses could be *ours*.  
So, in this work, I recreated that *imaginary home* from my childhood.

Since the streetlights are on, it must be evening.  
This house belongs to **three families** — one in the basement, one on the first floor, and one on the second.  
All the windows are lit, which makes me imagine that each family is enjoying dinner together tonight.

Even a single image can hold countless stories.  
That’s why I placed this house on top of an open book —  
to make it look as if this peaceful scene belongs to a story yet to be told.

What kind of lives might these three families be living inside this book?
