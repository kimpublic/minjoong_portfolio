Hello! Iâ€™m **Minjoong Kim**, currently studying **Computer Science (Games & Animation Emphasis)** at **Brigham Young University (BYU)**.  

Growing up, I always loved art. After winning a small award in an elementary school art contest, I began to value things that look and sound beautiful.  
That love for aesthetics naturally led me to fall in love not only with playing games but also with everything that makes them immersiveâ€”**visual design, background music, and storytelling**.  
I also adore **musicals** and **animation**, especially **musical animation**.

Thatâ€™s why I chose to major in **CS Animation at BYU**.  
This page is a collection of my personal works and creative projects. I hope you enjoy browsing!

> **Tools:** Autodesk Maya | Substance Painter

## Works


## ðŸŽ¬ Project 1 â€” *Where the Gaze Lands*

![Where the Gaze Lands](assets/works/where_the_gaze_lands_main.jpg)

This was my very first modeling project created in Maya â€” my first encounter with 3D art.  
At that time, my third sister got married, and I wanted to make something to celebrate her wedding.

When a father walks his daughter down the aisle, countless emotions must cross his mind.  
He blesses her happiness while realizing that he is no longer her strongest protector.  
In that moment, he might feel a quiet sense of loss or emotions too deep to describe.  
I wanted to capture that fragile yet profound moment.

This piece depicts **three figures** â€” the bride, the groom, and the brideâ€™s father.  
While the fatherâ€™s and groomâ€™s gazes are clearly directed, **the brideâ€™s gaze is intentionally left unseen**.  
Because where we look often reveals where our heart truly belongs.  

So, **whom is the bride looking at?**
