Hello! Iâ€™m **Minjoong Kim**, currently studying **Computer Science (Games & Animation Emphasis)** at **Brigham Young University (BYU)**.  

Growing up, I always loved art. After winning a small award in an elementary school art contest, I began to value things that look and sound beautiful.  
That love for aesthetics naturally led me to fall in love not only with playing games but also with everything that makes them immersiveâ€”**visual design, background music, and storytelling**.  
I also adore **musicals** and **animation**, especially **musical animation**.

Thatâ€™s why I chose to major in **CS Animation at BYU**.  
This page is a collection of my personal works and creative projects. I hope you enjoy browsing!

> **Tools:** Autodesk Maya | Substance Painter
