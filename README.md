## About Me

Hello! I’m **Minjoong Kim**, currently studying **Computer Science (Games & Animation Emphasis)** at **BYU**.

Growing up, I always loved art. After winning a small award in an elementary school art contest, I began to value things that look and sound beautiful. That love for aesthetics naturally led me to fall in love not only with playing games but also with everything that makes them immersive—**visual design, background music, and storytelling**. I also adore **musicals** and **animation**, especially **musical animation**.

That’s why I chose to major in **CS Animation at BYU**.  
This repository is a living collection of my works. I hope you enjoy browsing!

> **Tools:** Maya | Substance Painter
